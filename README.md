# DAO Swap

An open source interface for DAO Swap --a fork of ZeroExchange providing cross-chain swapping for DVG token

## Development

### Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

### Run

```bash
yarn start
```

### Configuring the environment (optional)

To have the interface default to a different network when a wallet is not connected:

1. Make a copy of `.env.production` named `.env`
2. Change `REACT_APP_NETWORK_URL` to e.g. `"https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/{YOUR_INFURA_KEY}"`

Note that the interface only works on testnets where both
[Uniswap V2](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/smart-contracts/factory/) and
[multicall](https://github.com/makerdao/multicall) are deployed.
The interface will not work on other networks.
